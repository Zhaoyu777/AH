# AngularJS integration

If you're using AngularJS in conjunction with your Symfony app and need
to expose your translations to it, you can do so by using the [Angular
Symfony Translation
module](https://github.com/boxuk/angular-symfony-translation).

Further documentation for using this module is available at the above
link.
